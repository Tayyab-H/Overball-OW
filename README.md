# Overball-OW

Overball! This is a football/Uplink style game mode. Walk over the ball to pick it up. Interact key to throw it. Throw the ball into the goal to score. First to 5 goals wins. You are hacked while holding the ball. Certain abillities can interact with the ball (boop, hook, mei wall, coach gun, deflect, whipshot). Crouch + interact to see score board, jump + interact to close it. The mode is complete with full ball physics, jumpads and currently has multiple maps, with many more being added. 

In this repo there is an Overpy file and the overwatch custom game file as a text file. Overpy files can be compiled into copy and pastable Overwatch Custom Game Script using the VSCode Overpy Extension!
