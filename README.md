# Overball-OW

Overball! This is a football/Uplink style game mode. Walk over the ball to pick it up. Interact key to throw it. Throw the ball into the goal to score. First to 5 goals wins. You are hacked while holding the ball. Certain abillities can interact with the ball (boop, hook, mei wall, coach gun, deflect, whipshot). Crouch + interact to see score board, jump + interact to close it. The mode is complete with full ball physics, jumpads and currently has multiple maps, with many more being added. 

In this repo there is an Overpy file and the overwatch custom game file as a text file. Overpy files can be compiled into copy and pastable Overwatch Custom Game Script using the VSCode Overpy Extension!

The files marked "[Deprecated]" no longer work. These were the original files i worked on when the workshop came out. Not only were we limited by having only 26 global and 26 player vars (one for each letter of the english alphabet of which i used every letter) there were no embeded if statements either making development more or less hell for gamemodes of this scale. The Overwatch Team broke the workshop a few times with various updates and due to the nature of the early workshop, maintaining this mode was more or less impossible. So i'm working on completely reworking this mode with the new tools available, these are the files that arent deprecated.
